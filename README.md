# IRIC: A Causal Network Structure Learning Method via Item Response Theory

The relationships between knowledge components are a fundamental basis for the realization of personalization in adaptive systems. Learning about correlation does not readily enable the extraction of true causal relationships between knowledge components from data. Traditional Bayesian network structure learning methods are overly generalized, missing potential insights during the learning process.

## What is IRIC?

IRIC, or *Item Response Theory based Information Criterion Causal Network Structure Learning Method*, is our innovative approach to uncover latent relationships between knowledge components by integrating **information entropy** and **causal effects**.

### Key Features

- **Integration of Information Entropy and Causal Effects**: This allows a more nuanced understanding of knowledge component relationships.
- **Structure Search Algorithm**: An evolutionary concept-based algorithm combined with a new scoring function enhances both efficiency and accuracy.
- **Proven Effectiveness**: Demonstrated exceptional performance on public and real-world datasets.
